{"name":"Touchy","body":"# Touchy\r\n\r\nTouchy is a jQuery plugin for managing touch and gesture events on WebKit browsers, such as Mobile Safari or Android Browser, or any browser that supports the ontouchstart, ontouchmove and ontouchend events.  \r\n\r\nIt creates new custom events that a programmer may utilize at a high level, such as \"touchy-pinch\" and \"touchy-rotate\" among others, and thus avoid the low-level work of combining touch and gesture events to achieve these common gestural controls.\r\n\r\nThe minified file size is ~9.52KB (~2.72KB gzipped)\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nFirst, load Touchy after jQuery.  Touchy requires jQuery 1.4.2+.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n    <!-- content -->\r\n    <script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"path/to/my/js/jquery.touchy.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen bind a Touchy event to a handler.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar handleTouchyPinch = function (e, $target, data) {\r\n    $target.css({'webkitTransform':'scale(' + data.scale + ',' + data.scale + ')'});\r\n};\r\n$('#my_div').bind('touchy-pinch', handleTouchyPinch);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Touchy Events\r\n\r\nTouchy currently enables the use of the following events:\r\n\r\n* touchy-longpress\r\n* touchy-drag\r\n* touchy-pinch\r\n* touchy-rotate\r\n* touchy-swipe\r\n\r\nThese events are triggered by user interactions with a specific \"phase\" of the user's gesture passed to the event handler.  A touchy-drag event, for example, will be triggered when the user first touches the bound element, when the user drags his or her finger across the screen, and when the user stops touching the screen.\r\n\r\nThe events are all prefixed with \"touchy-\" to avoid name collision.\r\n\r\n## Data Passed to Event Handlers\r\n\r\nThe general pattern of the arguments passed to an event handler is as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nhandleTouchyEvent(event, phase, $target, data);\r\n```\r\n\r\n* event (Object) - a jQuery event object.\r\n* phase (String) - the phase of the user gesture: \"start\", \"move\", \"end\".\r\n* $target (Object) - a jQuery object wrapping the event target\r\n* data (Object) - a JSON object with additional information about the user gesture.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there are exceptions to this pattern.  Please see below.\r\n\r\n### touchy-longpress\r\n\r\nphase: \"start\" or \"end\"\r\n(No data object)\r\n\r\n### touchy-drag\r\n\r\nphase: \"start\", \"move\" or \"end\"\r\n\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n* movePoint\r\n* lastMovePoint\r\n* startPoint\r\n* velocity\r\n\r\nPoints are JSON objects containing \"x\" and \"y\" pixel-based properties, relative to the page.\r\nVelocity is the distance / time measured in pixels and milliseconds, based on the last two ontouchmove events.\r\n\r\n### touchy-pinch\r\n\r\n(No phase.  All events are essentially within the \"move\" phase.)\r\n\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n* scale\r\n* previousScale\r\n* currentPoint\r\n* startPoint\r\n* startDistance\r\n\r\nScale is the percentage of the current distance between the two fingers, relative to the start distance.\r\nPoints are JSON objects containing \"x\" and \"y\" pixel-based properties, relative to the page.\r\nThe startDistance is measured in pixels.\r\n\r\n### touchy-rotate\r\n\r\nphase: \"start\", \"move\" and \"end\"\r\n\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n* startPoint\r\n* startDate (\"move\" and \"end\" phase only)\r\n* movePoint\r\n* lastMovePoint\r\n* degrees\r\n* degreeDelta (\"move\" and \"end\" phase only)\r\n* velocity\r\n\r\nPoints are JSON objects containing \"x\" and \"y\" pixel-based properties, relative to the page.\r\nVelocity is the distance / time measured in pixels and milliseconds, based on the last two ontouchmove events.\r\n\r\n### touchy-swipe\r\n\r\n(No phase.  Swipe triggers only once.  See configurations.)\r\n\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n* direction: \"left\", \"right\", \"up\", \"down\"\r\n* movePoint\r\n* lastMovePoint\r\n* startPoint\r\n* velocity\r\n\r\nPoints are JSON objects containing \"x\" and \"y\" pixel-based properties, relative to the page.\r\nVelocity is the distance / time measured in pixels and milliseconds, based on the last two ontouchmove events.\r\n\r\n## Overriding Default Configuration Settings\r\n\r\nTouchy configurations are stored within the bound element's jQuery data object.  One may override default configurations by assigning new values to properties within the data object after the element is bound to a touchy event.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('#my_div').bind('touchy-rotate', handleTouchyRotate);\r\n$('#my_div').data('touchyRotate').settings.requiredTouches = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown in the example, the settings are accessed through the camelCased name of the event.  All events except touchy-pinch require one finger touch by default, but may be configured to require more.\r\n\r\n### touchy-longpress\r\n\r\n* requiredTouches: 1\r\n* msThresh: 800 (the number of milliseconds the user must touch the element before the event is fired)\r\n* triggerStartPhase: false (whether to trigger the event during the start phase)\r\n\r\n### touchy-drag\r\n\r\n* requiredTouches: 1\r\n* msHoldThresh: 100 (a threshold before engaging drag, to avoid conflict with tapping gestures)\r\n\r\n### touchy-pinch \r\n\r\n* pxThresh: 0 (a pixel-based distance threshold that may be used to prevent the event from firing)\r\n\r\n### touchy-rotate\r\n\r\n* requiredTouches: 1\r\n\r\n### touchy-swipe\r\n\r\n* requiredTouches: 1\r\n* velocityThresh: 1 (required velocity to fire the event)\r\n* triggerOn: \"touchmove\" (or \"touchend\".  By default, as soon as the velocity is reached, the event fires.)\r\n\r\n## Using event delegation\r\n\r\nBy default, Touchy events are **not** able to be bound on ancestors of the target elements in a typical \"event delegation\" design pattern.  One may configure Touchy to do this, but unlike normal event delegation, it is computationally expensive.\r\n\r\nTo use event delegation:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.touchyOptions.useDelegation = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this is a global operation affecting all Touchy events.\r\n\r\n\r\n**enjoy!**\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"jQuery plugin for touch events","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
